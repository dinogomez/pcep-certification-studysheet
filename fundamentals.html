                            When you write a program in C/C++, you have to compile it.
                            Compilation involves translating your human understandble code to
                            machine understandable code, or
                            <span class="emphasize">Machine Code</span>.
                            Machine code is the base level form of instructions that can be
                            directly executed by the CPU. Upon succesfull compilation, your
                            code generates an executable file.

                            For most part, Python is an interpreted language and not a
                            compiled one. Although compilation is a step. Python code, written
                            in a
                            <span class="emphasize">.py</span> file is
                            first compiled to what is called a bytecode which is stored with a
                            <span class="emphasize">.pyc</span> or
                            <span class="emphasize">.pyo</span>
                            format. Instead of of translating code to machine code, Python
                            translates it to
                            <span class="emphasize">bytecode</span>. This
                            bytecode is a low-level set of instructions that can be executed
                            by an
                            <span class="emphasize">interpreter</span>.

                            Dynamic typing provides a lot of freedom, but simultaneously it
                            makes your code risky and sometimes difficult to debug. Python is
                            often accused of being <span class="emphasize">‘slow’</span>. Now while the term is relative and
                            argued a lot, the reason for being slow is because the interpreter
                            has to do extra work to have the bytecode instruction translated
                            into a form that can be executed on the machine. A StackOverflow

                            In older programming languages, memory allocation was quite manual. Many times when you use variables that are no longer in use or referenced anywhere else in the program, they need to be cleaned from the memory. Garbage Collector does that for you. It automatically frees up space without you doing anything. The memory management works in two ways —
