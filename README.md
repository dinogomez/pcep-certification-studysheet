Compilation involves translating your human understandble code to machine understandable code, or Machine Code. Machine code is the base level form of instructions that can be directly executed by the CPU. Upon succesfull compilation, your code generates an executable file.</p>

Python code, written in a **.py** file is first compiled to what is called a bytecode which is stored with a **.pyc** or **.pyo** format.  Instead of of translating code  to machine code, Python translates it to **bytecode**. This bytecode is a low-level set of instructions that can be executed by an **interpreter**. Most pc has their python interpreter located at `/usr/local/bin/python3.8`.
